                        <p>We show that even basic machine learning, as well as more advanced hand-crafted and genetically-discovered models, can outperform the current state of the art in fast-paced patient risk prioritization in predicting if a child has sleep apnea or not.</p>

                        <p>Partnering with researchers at a major medical school in the US, we explored if we could improve on the current in-person tests to prioritize pediatric sleep apnea cases. Currently, a nurse or doctor asks a series of questions and generates a point score estimating the likelihood the patient has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the level of severity, and the necessary testing. This testing is extremely costly (~$3B/year total spent) and time consuming (a 12+ hour hospital stay). If we could develop a machine learning tool that prioritizes high-risk cases better using only information available to the nurse, we are more likely to get kids the care they need, quicker.</p>

                        <p>Working with small (~450 observation) datasets, we show how both feature engineering and hierarchical models can improve over the state of the art in doctor heuristics. We discuss their generalization capabilities across new datasets.</p>

                    <div class='col-sm-8'>
                        <p>We're able to outperform leading human doctor heuristics for patient prioritization. One advantage is this could be based entirely on data collected by a nurse or trained person at home, democratizing patient care prioritization. Results are motivating an application for wider-scale studies, across many thousands of patients at multiple sleep centres.</p>
