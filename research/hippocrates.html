                        <p>I'm building a tool to generate time-dynamic synthetic controls. This exploits information of control units post-treatment to estimate the treatment counterfactual.</p>

                        <p>To do causal inference, you often want to infer a "counterfactual" -- what would have happened to some unit (patient, country, etc.) if they'd received a different treatment. Synthetic controls estimate the counterfactual by learning a mapping from control "donor" units to the treated unit pre-treatment. However, this ignores post-treatment information, such as if donor units become more or less appropriate control group members. It turns out we can leverage post-treatment behaviour of the control units to estimate time-dynamic relationships after treatment, leading to more robust estimates of the counterfactual.</p>

                        <p>In the time series case, you can see the counterfactual estimation problem as a combination of a missing data problem and a transfer learning problem. By using multitask Gaussian processes with a specific optimization regime, you can infer the synthetic control more accurately. This enables custom handling of control group surprises using priors over the kernels used.</p>
