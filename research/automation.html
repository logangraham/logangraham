                        <p>We surveyed 150+ machine learning/robotics experts to collect 4500 datapoints on what work tasks are automatable today. We modeled the relationship between task skills, knowledge, and ability and the task automatability.</p>

                        <p>Despite alarm about automation, we don't have good data on what can be automated in the first place. Most approaches focus on occupations, which mistakes the unit of automation: tasks themselves. Further, collecting data to produce a general and nuanced taxonomy of automatability is very expensive.</p>

                        <p>We collected a novel dataset and developed a bespoke machine learning approach to this computatational social science problem. We generate automatability labels by using a Bayesian technique to combine multiple uncertain classifiers' (expert labellers') estimates. Then we use an ordinal-likelihood Gaussian Process to model the relationship between activity features and activity automatability labels. We analyse results across work types, occupation groups, income, education. We discuss where the model most disagrees with ground truth labels, and use model gradients to determine the features that drive automatability the most.</p>
