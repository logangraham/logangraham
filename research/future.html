                        <p>I acted as the first lead consultant to prepare all data and some strategy on an innovative human-in-the-loop ML model to predict future job and skills demand.</p>

                    <div class='col-sm-8'>
                        <p>Working with Pearson, Nesta, and the University of Oxford, we were tasked with devising a new method of soliciting expert predictions on the future of skills. The envisioned method would be a series of iterative workshops where experts would discuss and predict outcomes for occupations, and based on the score and expert uncertainty, suggest new maximally-informative occupations for experts to discuss. Given the time-consuming nature of the challenge, we needed a model that would become maximally certain about the future of demand as quick as possible.</p>

                        <p>I developed all the data preparation needed for expert evaluation and helped with the modelling strategy. We presented historical employment, industry, skills, and title data for occupations going back to the 1980s. The model is a Gaussian Process active learning model that modelled informativeness across the occupation feature-demand space, choosing occupations that would most reduce uncertainty.</p>

                        <p>the <a href='https://futureskills.pearson.com/research/'>Pearson Future of Skills report</a> was widely publicized and, to the best of our knowledge, used by Pearson for strategy setting. It has also inspired new research work outside of the UK by other think tanks.</p>
