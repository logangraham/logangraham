                    <div class='col-sm-8'>
                        <p>A 4-million client health insurance company came to RAIL seeking to leverage their data to better predict diabetes so that patients can be cared for before it becomes a problem. This is a win-win-win for the patient, a resource-constrained healthcare system, and the insurer. The modelling challenge is low-incidence of diabetes onset and the need for explainability in face of both a highly regulated industry and human-machine decisionmaking.</p>

                        <p>We used a splitting-oversampling-synthesizing data preparation model to augment existing data. This had a 50% AUC boost over non-augmented modelling. Between several classifiers, CatBoost performed best due to the mixed nature of the data, and the ability to handle missing data as an information-containing signal for prediction. It was clear that the biggest limitation to performance was limited data, so I developed a data acquisition strategy for the partner. Immeidately they were capable of capturing more high dimensional data, which necessitated suggestions around dealing with high-dimensional data and finding robust embeddings separating diabetes-positive and negative cases.</p>

                        <p>Not only did we allow the partner to think through its data acquistion and modelling pipeline to form a foundation for future performance, but our model was able to match and slightly outperform what internal benchmark models were producing.</p>
