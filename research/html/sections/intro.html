<p>My main research focus is on <b>causality</b> and <b>interpretability</b>. I am interested in how we can use (hidden) causal information to improve reasoning, whether for causal or non-causal questions. I mostly use Bayesian nonparametric methods and challenges, with a focus on Gaussian Processes, Bayesian Optimization, and Bayesian Quadrature. In the long-term, I am interested in how causal structure is useful in building probabilistic systems that learn good generative models while performing inference well. I am also interested in economic questions, and have done work on the future of work and automation, as well as interesting challenges using machine learning for societal good.</p>
