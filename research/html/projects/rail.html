                    <b>In a tweet:</b> During the second year of my PhD, I co-founded an applied machine learning lab of 25 graduate students. We worked with partners on ML challenges with societal impact, going from data to prototype in 8 weeks.

                <div class='row project-section'>
                    <b>Overview:</b> My co-founder and I felt a need to translate our research into real-world actions. In particular, we wanted to test the notion of ML as a silver bullet for challenging social problems. What high-impact societal challenges were undertargeted and uniquely addressable with machine learning? We gathered 25 graduate students (half engineers and technical researchers, and half strategists) and sourced challenging problems from governments, large companies, startups, and universities. RAIL operates under a "sprint" model -- from code and conception to model and validation in 8 weeks or less.

                <div class='row project-section'>
                    <b>Results:</b> We've worked with Google, the City of new York, Public Health England, the UK Parliament Future of Work Commision, the University of Oxford & the University of Maryland, a multibillion-dollar health insurer, several startups in health and energy, and others. Some of our work has produced academic papers, others have gotten students jobs, and all have lead our partners to a greater understanding of how to deploy ML in tough societal challenges.

                    Most importantly, I learned that there are an exceptional number of problems in the world that are data-rich, usefully tackled by machine learning, and have a large societal challenge. The greatest barrier is a lack of institutional capacity to address them. I'm excited for a future of ML that is easier to deploy to more general problems. We proved it could be done with no more than some excited graduate students, pizza, and supportive partners.
