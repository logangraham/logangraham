                    <b>In a tweet:</b> using out-of-the-box machine learning approaches, we show we can outperform the current state of the art in fast-paced patient risk prioritization in predicting if a child has sleep apnea or not.

                <div class='row project-section'>
                    <b>Challenge:</b> partnering with the School of Medicine at the University of Maryland-Baltimore, we explored if we could improve on the current in-person tests to prioritize pediatric sleep apnea cases. Currently, a nurse or doctor asks a series of questions and generates a point score estimating the likelihood the patient has sleep apnea or needs testing. This testing is extremely costly (~$3B/year total spent) and time consuming (takes a 12+ hour hospital stay). If we could develop a machine learning tool that prioritizes high-risk cases better using only information available to the nurse, we are more likely to get kids the care they need.

                <div class='row project-section'>
                    <b>Solution:</b> working with small (~450 observation) datasets, we used simple feature engineering and dimensionality reduction to increase the robustness of kernel-based classifiers. On k-fold cross validation, our method outperformed other low-data-regime classifiers as well as the current state-of-the-art of  points score-based human heuristic tests.

                <div class='row project-section'>
                    <b>Results:</b> We're able to outperform leading human doctor heuristics for patient prioritization. One advantage is this could be based entirely on data collected by a nurse or trained person at home, democratizing patient care prioritization. Results are motivating an application for wider-scale studies, across many thousands of patients at multiple sleep centres.
