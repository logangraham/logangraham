                    <b>In a tweet:</b> ML researchers have turned tremendous interest towards causality. I wrote a review paper detailing the latest research on how tools from causality are improving learning, efficiency, and generalization in machine learning tasks.

                    <b>Challenge:</b> Causality, among other topics, is one of the quickest growing subfields in machine learning. For various statistical and philosophical reasons is has a close relationship to intelligence. However, most research is tackling how to use ML to perform causal inference. I believed the reverse to be underrated, so I set out to document how machine learning researchers can use tools from causality to improve learning.

                    <b>Results:</b> I've written a review paper covering 50+ recent papers using tools from causality to improve machine learning. I cover how we can use tools from causality to improve generalization, efficiency, and concept learning.
