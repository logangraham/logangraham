                    <b>In a tweet:</b> I'm building a tool to generate time-dynamic synthetic controls. This exploits information of control units post-treatment to estimate the treatment counterfactual.

                <div class='row project-section'>
                    <b>Challenge:</b> To do causal inference, you often want to posit a "counterfactual" -- what would have happened to some unit (patient, country, etc.) if they'd received a different treatment. Synthetic controls estimate the counterfactual by learning a mapping from control "donor" units to the treated unit pre-treatment. However, this ignores post-treatment information, such as if donor units become more or less appropriate control group members. It turns out we can leverage post-treatment behaviour of the control units to estimate time-dynamic relationships after treatment, leading to more robust estimates of the counterfactual.

                <div class='row project-section'>
                    <b>Solution:</b> In the time series case, you can see the counterfactual estimation problem as a combination of missing data imputation and transfer learning problems. By using multitask Gaussian processes with a specific optimization regime, you can infer the synthetic control more accurately. This enables custom handling of control group surprises using priors over the kernels used.

                    <b>Results:</b> forthcoming. First results show (a) robustness to regime changes in donor units and (b) recovery of accurate synthetic controls.
