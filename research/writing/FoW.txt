Future of Work


In a tweet: Lead all the data preparation and analysis for a widely-publicized report on the future of work.

Challenge: Pearson (the education company) and Nesta came to us to devise a new way of using machine learning to project what occupations and skills would be in high demand in the future. The goal was to use human-in-the-loop labelling through in-person workshops to intelligently update our demand projection model.

Solution: We developed a model based on active learning that intelligently suggested the most informative occupations for labelling. In order to make this happen, I had to map out employment, industries, skills, titles, and more for every US and UK occupation since the ~80s. I lead all the data prep, Jonathan developed the model, and the authors at Nesta and my colleagues Jonathan and Michael finalized the report.
