Causality Review Paper


In a tweet: ML researchers have turned tremendous interest towards causality. I wrote a review paper detailing the latest research on how tools from causality are improving learning, efficiency, and generalization in machine learning tasks.

Challenge: Causality, among other topics, is one of the quickest growing subfields in machine learning. For various statistical and philosophical reasons is has a close relationship to intelligence. However, most research is tackling how to use ML to perform causal inference. I believed the reverse to be underrated, so I set out to document how machine learning researchers can use tools from causality to improve learning.

Solution:
- Review paper
- Generalization
- Efficiency
- Future research areas
