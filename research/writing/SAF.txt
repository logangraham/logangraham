In a tweet: a friend and colleague of mine are leading an individual research project on creating a Sovereign Wealth Fund-like institution for Canadian workers to benefit from automation.

Challenge: back in May, Viet and I won the 2018 Audacious Futures Canada competition, giving us a little grant to explore creating an institution that would incentivize innovation and reward workers for automation. In face of automation, Canada is at risk of slow growth, unemployment, and rising inequality. Labour productivity is dropping, and over 1/5 employees are employeed in (more automatable) goods producing sectors.

Solution: Viet and I are exploring how we could incentivize employees to drive automation in firms, the profits of which would convert to employee-held shares. In the long-term, the labour force would increasingly become capital owners. It is, in a sense, an laternative contribution mechanism for the Citizen's Dividend.
