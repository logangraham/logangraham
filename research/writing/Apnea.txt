Sleep Apnea

[ Graphic: patient questionnaire --> model --> priority score ]

In a tweet: using out-of-the-box machine learning approaches, we show we can outperform the current state of the art in fast-paced patient risk prioritization in predicting if a child has sleep apnea or not.

Challenge: partnering with the School of Medicine at the University of Maryland-Baltimore, we explored if we could improve on the current in-person tests to prioritize pediatric sleep apnea cases. Currently, a nurse or doctor asks a series of questions and generates a point score estimating the likelihood the patient has sleep apnea or needs testing. This testing is extremely costly (~$3B/year total spent) and time consuming (takes a 12+ hour hospital stay). If we could develop a machine learning tool that prioritizes high-risk cases better using only information available to the nurse, we are more likely to get kids the care they need.

Solution: working with small (~450 observation) datasets, we used simple feature engineering and dimensionality reduction to increase the robustness of kernel-based classifiers. On k-fold cross validation, our method outperformed other low-data-regime classifiers as well as the current state-of-the-art of  points score-based human heuristic tests.
