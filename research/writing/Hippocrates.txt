In a tweet: I'm building a tool to generate time-dynamic synthetic controls. This exploits information of control units post-treatment to estimate the treatment counterfactual.

[ Time series case ]

Challenge: To do causal inference, you often want to posit a "counterfactual" -- what would have happened to some unit (patient, country, etc.) if they'd received a different treatment. Synthetic controls estimate the counterfactual by learning a mapping from control units to the treated unit pre-treatment. It turns out we can leverage post-treatment behaviour of the control units to estimate time-dynamic relationships after treatment, leading to more robust estimates of the counterfactual.

[ Model ]

Solution: In the time series case, you can see the counterfactual estimation problem as a combination of missing data imputation and transfer learning problems. By using multitask Gaussian processes with a specific optimization regime, you can infer the synthetic control more accurately. This enables custom handling of control group surprises using priors over the kernels used.

Results:
- Recover accurate SC's
- Changepoint robust
- Probabilistic
