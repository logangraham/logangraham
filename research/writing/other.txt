I currently hold a Rhodes Scholarship (British Columbia and Balliol, 2015), and Oxford-Man Studentship at the Oxford Man Institute for Quantitative Finance.

In summer 2017 I was invited to be a participant at the Machine Learning Summer School in Tübingen, Germany. One of the best 2 weeks I've spent!

Ditchley – I've been an invited participant at the Ditchley Foundation twice, once for their Future of Artificial Intelligence Summit. I have also chaired panels at each of their annual Future Human festivals of ideas.

I occasionally publicly speak about machine learning. I very recently spoke as part of a CityWire/Blackrock future of finance event (videos here [1] [2] [3]).
